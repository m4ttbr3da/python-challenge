# Python Coding Examples

## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a fictitious company.

* The task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

  ```

* The final script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.

## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a (fictitious) small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* Using a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv), I created a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 3521001
  -------------------------
  Khan: 63.000% (2218231)
  Correy: 20.000% (704200)
  Li: 14.000% (492940)
  O'Tooley: 3.000% (105630)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Khan
  -------------------------
  ```

* The script prints the analysis to the terminal and exports a text file with the results.
